- ttyS0 is the device for the first UART serial port on x86 and x86_64 architectures. If you have a PC motherboard with serial ports you'd be using a ttySn to attach a modem or a serial console.
- ttyUSB0 is the device for the first USB serial convertor. If you have an USB serial cable you'd be using a ttyUSBn to connect to the serial port of a router.
- ttyAMA0 is the device for the first serial port on ARM architecture. If you have an ARM-based TV box with a serial console and running Android or OpenELEC, you'd be using a ttyAMAn to attach a console to it.
